### Active income

Active revenue is essential to support the continued development of the game and ensure its quality and long-term sustainability. Here are some sources of active revenue that Cataplesia plans to implement:

* **Presales:** Proceeds from presales are crucial to fund the continued development of the game and ensure its quality and longevity.&#x20;
* **Battle Pass:** Players unlock a variety of exclusive challenges and quests to earn unique rewards, which motivates participation and progression in the game.&#x20;
* **Cosmetic sales:** The sale of cosmetics through microtransactions provides additional, sustainable revenue to fund the game's ongoing development.&#x20;
* **Sponsorships and partnerships:** Partnerships with brands can generate revenue through in-game marketing or advertising agreements.

### Passive income

* **In-game store:** Implementing an in-game store to purchase cosmetic items, power-ups or convenience items will generate revenue.&#x20;
* **Commissions on transactions:** Take a small commission from all transactions within the ecosystem, such as NFT sales between players or transactions in the in-game internal market.
