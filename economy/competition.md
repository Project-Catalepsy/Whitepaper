# 🏁 Competition

## Community Well

The **community well** is the source of rewards for players, supplied through commissions generated by exchanges of goods (NFT) or pre-sales. This structure guarantees sustainable rewards proportional to the activity and commitment of the player community.&#x20;

The fund is filled with a percentage of contributions, reflecting the support and participation of the community. By distributing this fund among competitors at the beginning of each season, it ensures that rewards are fair and based on individual player performance during the competition. This promotes a fair and transparent playing environment.

### Seasons

The competition is divided into seasons. Each season will have a duration of 35 days, where players will be able to compete. After each season, there will be a 15-day rest period that will allow players to recover, plan strategies and prepare for the next season.&#x20;

Throughout the seasons, the community pot will be filled with contributions from the community. The proceeds from one season will be used for the subsequent season's rewards.

* **Season 0:** The proceeds from this season will be used for Season 1 rewards.&#x20;
* **Season 1:** The reward will be the proceeds from the previous season (Season 0).&#x20;
* **Season 2:** The reward will be the proceeds from the previous season (Season 1).&#x20;
* **Season 3:** The reward will be the proceeds from the previous season (Season 2).

The pre-season reward (15 days) will be distributed at the discretion of the players through the DAO. It can be used as an event reward, eventual additional reward, etc.

#### Mutations

Enemies receive mutations that alter their behavior, either by varying their movements or attacks. Each mutation has a low % chance of appearing.&#x20;

To make the seasons interesting. 48 mutations will be designed, and a number of 12 will be chosen randomly for players to adapt to the variants of the enemies.

#### Courses

Players through the DAO will be able to choose 3 curses that disable the selected runes. In this way, the strongest runes will be taken out of the game, and each season will be different.

#### Equitable distribution

To avoid some of the seasons the rewards are very low or null, the collection will have the following rules:&#x20;

* If during a season the reward contributed by the community pot can never exceed $1M. If at any time this amount is exceeded, the difference will be kept and will become part of the next season.&#x20;
* If during a season the reward contributed by the community pot is less than $40,000, there will be no rewards that season. However, it is possible to inject the necessary liquidity. This can be discussed through the DAO.

## Abysmal Descent

The Abyssal Descent is the first competition mode of Cataplesia. An intense competition in which players descend through the Infernal Abyss, while being evaluated on their performance. The speed with which they advance, the efficiency with which they defeat enemies and the skill with which they use items would be key factors in determining their score in the competition.

Depending on their score, they will be ranked in a leaderboard divided into 5 sections. Each section will be rewarded according to the abundance of the community pool.

### How to compete?

To compete in Cataplesia, players can activate the competition mode before entering the Infernal Abyss.&#x20;

Once activated, the game will evaluate your performance while exploring the Abyss. The game will make a detailed record of various actions and events during your descent. This will include tracking enemies defeated, the speed at which you descend the abyss, and how you use items.

### Divisions

The Infernal Abyss is made up of the following divisions:

* **Shady Den:** Levels 1 - 5&#x20;
* **Shadow Trench:** Levels 6 - 10&#x20;
* **Deep Grotto:** Levels 11 - 15&#x20;
* **Maw of Darkness:** Levels 16 - 20

### Rewards

Each division has a reward in dollars that varies according to the amount of dollars in the community pot. 100% of the pot is shared among all divisions.

* **Shady Den:** 10%
* **Shadow Trench:** 25%
* **Deep Grotto:** 30%
* **Maw of Darkness:** 35%

The top 100 players in each division will be eligible for the rewards. Here is an example of a division that gets $100,000 to be distributed among the top 100 players.
