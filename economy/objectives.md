# ðŸ’² Objectives

We have developed an economy focused on the value that NFTs bring, distancing ourselves from models based solely on tokens, where organized groups or individuals can influence or negatively affect a project.&#x20;

For us, time is the most valuable currency. That is why we structure our economy around the time invested by our players.&#x20;

Players have diverse opportunities to generate revenue, understanding that some make gains while others may experience losses. However, we strive to offer a wide variety of revenue-earning options to accommodate all types of players.&#x20;

In the future, we plan to introduce new ways for both our investors and our players to generate additional income. These opportunities will be added gradually as we move forward on our roadmap - stay tuned so you don't miss out on anything new!
