# ðŸš€ Launcher

The launcher will be an application from where the ecosystem around Catalepsia will run. The goal is to reduce the barrier of entry that exists in the #Gamefi sector by emphasizing accessibility, usability and user experience to attract new players to the blockchain.&#x20;

To achieve this, we believe we must merge the typical features of a web2 launcher with web3 functionalities. Our launcher will function as a wallet. This way, a new player will not have to understand how to create a wallet, fund, etc. Everything will run in the background.

## Blockchain features

* **Wallet:** Our launcher will have the functions of a wallet. Want to buy an NFT? Forget about having to go through several complex steps. Just enter the balance with a credit/debit card and purchase the NFT you want. Have you won a prize in a tournament? We deposit the USDT in your wallet and choose whether to withdraw or spend it.&#x20;
* **Marketplace:** Offers access to the integrated marketplace where users can buy, sell, and trade NFTs.&#x20;
* **Asset management:** Manage your purchased assets from the launcher.&#x20;
* **DAO Access:** Allows users to participate in the DAO to make collective decisions about the project.

## Other features

* **Catalepsia Launcher:** The launcher provides access for players to run the game: Catalepsia.
* **Automatic Updates:** The launcher will have the ability to automatically search for and download Catalepsia updates, ensuring users always have the latest available version.
* **Profile Management:** Users will be able to manage their user profile, game settings, and custom preferences.
* **Friends and Chat:** Allows players to add friends and communicate via private messages.
* **Authentication and Security:** Includes security measures such as two-factor authentication to protect user accounts against unauthorized access.
* **Community and Social Networks:** Direct access to player communities surrounding the project.
* **News:** Allows players to stay updated with the latest news and updates from Catalepsia.\
