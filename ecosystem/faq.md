</details>

<details>

A gate is equivalent to a land in most NFT games. Lands gain value due to their scarcity, proximity to the center of the game's universe, or if they have more resources than others. As artificial values, in most cases they lose part or all of their value. Gates work in reverse. They are distributed to all players and gain value as the player invests time in the game.
