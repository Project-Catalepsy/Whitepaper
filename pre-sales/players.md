# üèÅ Players

In most #Gamefi projects, it is promised that you will be both a player and an investor. However, this duality generates the following inconsistencies:

1. **Conflict of Interest:** As a player, your main objective is to enjoy the game, while as an investor, you are interested in maximizing your profits. This can create conflicts in decision-making, as what benefits one may harm the other.
2. **Divergent Priorities:** Players may be more interested in the quality of the game and the user experience, while investors may be more focused on the financial performance of the project. This can lead to important aspects of the game being neglected in pursuit of greater financial gains.
3. **Market Volatility:** The volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market can negatively impact the gaming experience, as asset prices can fluctuate drastically and affect the in-game economy, resulting in an inconsistent experience for players.
4. **Lack of Transparency:** Some projects may not be transparent about how investment funds are managed and used for game development. This can create mistrust among players and investors, affecting the overall credibility of the project.

At Catalepsia, we have separated the roles of investor and player, **so a player will never be treated as an investor.** Our goal is to provide you with a genuine and exciting gaming experience. However, if a player wishes, they can acquire tokens.

## Benefits

Participating in the presale as a player can have several benefits even if you are not interested in becoming an investor:

1. **Early access:** Pre-sales can offer you the opportunity to access the game before its official release, allowing you to explore and enjoy the experience before other players.&#x20;
2. **Exclusivity:** You can get exclusive rewards, bonuses or in-game items that will not be available to those who join later.&#x20;
3. **Discounts (NFT):** During the pre-sale, the purchase of NFT can have special discounts, allowing you to get unique virtual items at a lower price.&#x20;
4. **Digital Assets:** You will have the opportunity to acquire exclusive digital assets that may increase in value over time. These assets may include unique items, such as skins, special characters or artifacts, which will enhance your gaming experience.

Long-term, as the project progresses, new ways will be designed for players to benefit even more. We are committed to continuing to innovate and offer exciting opportunities for players to earn returns on their assets. These new features could include additional gameplay mechanics, special events, and integrations with other platforms, among others. Our goal is to ensure that players always have diverse and rewarding ways to make the most of their gaming experience.

## Return on assets

We recognize that many people may not agree with decoupling the figure of the investor from the player. Aware of this, the project has been developed so that players have various ways of generating returns on their assets without assuming the risk of being investors.

* **Buy/Sell (NFT):** Through the NFT store, you can buy and sell digital assets to get a return on your assets. With the right strategy, you can make the most of these transactions and earn significant profits.&#x20;
* **Competition:** Participate in competitions where you can obtain rewards in dollars granted by the community pool. Show your skills in the game and be rewarded for your achievements. Collector: Become a collector of rare digital assets and look for opportunities to trade with other collectors. By acquiring and owning unique assets, you can increase their value and profit through future transactions.&#x20;
* **Resources:** Explore the abyss to obtain valuable resources that can be acquired by competitive players. Your commitment to the game can translate into monetary return by obtaining and trading these resources in-game.
