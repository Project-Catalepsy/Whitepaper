# üè¨ Investors

Pre-sales offer prospective investors the opportunity to acquire shares in the company through Security Tokens, giving them a direct stake in the business and the promise of returns as the company's ecosystem expands and generates profits. These tokens are considered investments and can confer similar rights to traditional shareholders, such as dividends and voting rights, and are subject to specific securities regulations in most jurisdictions.&#x20;

By acquiring these Security Tokens, investors secure their stake in the company, allowing them to benefit from the growth potential of the business. In addition to the appreciation in the value of the shares represented by the tokens, investors could receive dividends as part of the company's profit distribution policy. This combination of traditional stock market features with the innovation of blockchain technology provides an exciting and accessible way to invest in the project and share in its long-term success.

### Strategic Expansion

In our long-term vision, we recognize that the true potential of our vision goes beyond the games themselves. Our business can expand in multiple ways:

1. **Revenue Diversification:** By expanding into areas such as books, comics, and merchandising, we are diversifying our sources of income. This allows us to reduce dependence on a single market and establish a stronger foundation for long-term growth.
2. **Audience Expansion:** By offering a variety of products and services, we are attracting a broader audience. This enables us to increase our market share and reach new segments of users who may be interested in our offerings.
3. **Synergies and Cross-Marketing:** Our expansion provides us with the opportunity to leverage synergies between different products and services. For example, promoting a comic based on our game IP can increase interest in the game itself, generating a virtuous cycle of user engagement.
4. **Brand Strengthening:** By establishing a presence in multiple areas, we are strengthening our brand and increasing customer loyalty. This allows us to build a strong community of followers who feel connected to our vision and values.
5. **Resilience to Changes:** Diversifying our business makes us more resilient to market changes. If one sector experiences a slowdown, others can compensate, ensuring our stability and continuous growth.
