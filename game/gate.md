# ðŸšª Gate

The gates in the underworld are vivid representations of the sins that humans accumulate during their lives, shaped based on their unique skill configuration. Each gate stands imposing, revealing the individual's mistakes and transgressions before them. To atone for these sins and advance in the underworld, it is required to fill the gate with blood shards, thus raising its level and granting access to deeper levels of the dark realm.

## Types

Each gate is linked to a specific type of blood: A, AB, B, and O. These blood types determine the abilities that a container can use. Each blood type grants the container access to a distinct set of abilities, each with its own properties and benefits.

This variety in blood types and available abilities adds strategic depth to the game. Additionally, it encourages exploration and experimentation, as players can discover new combinations of abilities to adapt to different situations and optimize their progress in the underworld.

## Rarities

The rarity of the gates is linked to the rarity of their blood type. This rarity will determine what types of abilities the container can use.

| rarity  | Equivalencia |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Type O  | Common       |
| Type A  | Uncommon     |
| Type B  | Rare         |
| Type AB | Legendary    |

### Rh

The Rh factor determines the compatibility of abilities between blood types. It is decided with a probability of 60% for negative blood types and 40% for positive ones.

## Levels

Levels are essential for opening the descent gates of the abyss, once the gate has reached a sufficient level, allowing the player to venture into the darkest and most dangerous depths of the realm in search of even greater treasures and challenges.&#x20;

Each successful expedition grants the player the opportunity to introduce blood shards into the gate, allowing them to increase its level and advance in this dark realm. Each level of the gate requires the same number of blood shards for filling, and the maximum number of levels is infinite, meaning there is no limit to the number of levels a player can reach.

### Transfusion

Players have the opportunity to perform a gate level transfusion. When two players decide to carry out this transaction, the process begins with an agreement between both parties, where the player seeking to increase their gate levels must pay compensation to the other player. For example, if Player A possesses 100 levels and Player B has only 5 levels, Player B must offer compensation to Player A to initiate the transfusion.

To prevent abuse of this system, for every transfusion performed, a 20% loss of blood shards occurs. This penalty aims to discourage excessive exchange and promote more careful management of the available resources in the underworld. Thus, players must carefully consider whether the benefit of increasing their gate levels through transfusion justifies the associated cost.

## Properties of NFT

The gate is an NFT assigned to each player and represents the player's progression. They are equivalent to the "Lands" of an NFT Game, but... How can it have value if everyone has it? Unlike Lands that have artificial value surrounded by promises (closer to the city, more/less resources, etc.), gates acquire value by using the most valuable resource in the world, **our time**.

As players explore and participate in the game, they have the opportunity to increase the value of the gate by sacrificing blood shards (the most valuable resource in the game) to increase its level. Levels grant access to better abilities, unique events, etc. Let's see it with an example:\


|                               | Player A | Player B  |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Gate Cost (Pre-sale)          | $45      | $45       |
| Gameplay Time                 | 50 hours | 250 hours |
| Gate Level                    | Level 25 | Level 60  |
| Selling Price (1 month later) | $75      | $125      |

If a Player C hasn't been able to access the pre-sale but wants to compete in the shortest time possible, they can acquire a gate from another player. Both Player A and Player B have increased the value of their gate through a combination of time, skill, and strategy. It will be up to Player C to decide which gate to acquire based on their economic power.
