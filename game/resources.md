# ⁉️ Resources

During the exploration of the underworld levels, players have the opportunity to obtain a variety of resources that can be useful during their adventure.

## Key items

* **Blood Shard**: The blood shard is a small crystal rhombus, the edges of which are finely sculpted into sharp points that culminate in an angular shape. Its translucent structure allows light to filter through it, revealing shades of crimson and dark shadows that give the impression of depth and mystery. When broken, the shard releases the blood inside. Although elegant and mysterious in appearance, blood shards are highly coveted, representing a valuable bargaining chip for advancement and acquiring powerful resources.
* **Stash:** The cache is an ancestral artifact located on the surface available to those who venture into the Infernal Abyss. This chest, crafted from ebony wood and adorned with glowing runic inscriptions, emanates a mystical energy that attracts treasure seekers in search of a safe haven for their most prized possessions. Although located on the surface, the chest seems to be connected to the very essence of the abyss, offering a sense of security and protection to those who deposit their treasures within.
* **Codex Sanctus:** The Codex Sanctus is an ancient tome of mysterious and worn appearance, whose pages whisper ancient secrets forgotten by time. At first glance, it appears to have no use, but there are rumors that some containers have detected life locked within it. These claims suggest that the book could hold more than just written words, perhaps containing the power of a forgotten entity or even the essence of a celestial or infernal being. However, no one has been able to confirm these rumors, and the true purpose of the "Codex Sanctus" remains an enigma to those who study it closely.
* **Rosary:** The rosary is a sacred object that offers solace to those who carry it. Forged from dark ebony beads and adorned with sacred symbols, the rosary is a symbol of faith and devotion in the dark abyss. By reciting its prayers and meditating on its beads, the wearer can find solace in times of distress and danger. In addition to its spiritual value, it is rumored to possess the power to bless objects, purifying them of any evil influence or evil spell that may affect the wearer. For those who seek light in darkness and protection in adversity, the rosary is an indispensable companion on their journey through the terrors of the underworld.
