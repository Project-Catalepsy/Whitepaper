# ðŸŽ® Gameplay

\
In the depths of the abyss, awaits a singular challenge for the brave who dare to venture into its shadowy depths. Comprised of a descending succession of twenty levels, this vast underground domain presents a series of procedurally generated chambers, each with its own dangers and unique challenges.

This journey, permeated with risks and rewards, tests the courage and resolve of adventurers, challenging them to overcome adversities in search of the deepest mysteries that the abyss jealously guards. Will you dare to face this unparalleled challenge?

## How to Play?

he player must plan their descent into the depths of the abyss. Which skills to bring? Which potions to choose? Good planning and knowledge of the game will favor victory. Before starting the raid, the player must accept the following rules:

> In the Infernal Abyss, one cannot ascend,&#x20;
>
> Player death is permanent,&#x20;
>
> All rewards obtained will be lost upon death,&#x20;
>
> When the player dies or leaves the abyss,&#x20;
>
> they must start from the beginning.&#x20;
>
> These rules are immutable unless stated otherwis.

Once the raid has begun, the player must descend through 20 levels, overcoming the challenges that arise. The fact that only descent is allowed adds a sense of permanence and challenge to the game, as each decision to descend must be carefully considered.

### Sections

The 20 levels of the abyss are divided into 5 distinct sections themed with unique challenges.&#x20;

At the end of each section, the player must face a formidable boss guarding access to the next set of levels.&#x20;

Defeating the boss allows the player to obtain great rewards. Next, they must make a significant decision: continue descending or offer a prayer to leave the abyss and enjoy the loot obtained?

### **Levels**

Each level consists of rooms, ranging from 6 to 8 rooms procedurally generated with their own challenges.&#x20;

Once the player manages to overcome all the rooms of a level, they have the opportunity to descend to the next level of the abyss.&#x20;
