# ☠️ Player

## Container

The player embodies a non-living entity called the Container. This entity must accumulate blood to sustain its life. When the Container has no blood, its body is completely white and lifeless, but as it accumulates blood, its body gradually becomes redder and filled with vitality. This visual representation not only provides an intuitive way to understand the player's health status but also adds a layer of immersion to the game, allowing players to feel more connected to their character and their struggle to survive.

## Vida

The life system in the game consists of three main elements: platelets, blood, and plasma.&#x20;

* **Platelets**: This bar represents the character's general shield. Every time the character takes damage, platelets activate to form a temporary shield that reduces the damage received. If the bar reaches zero, the next damage received will deduct blood from the player.&#x20;
* **Blood:** This bar represents the character's overall health and decreases each time they take damage. If the health bar reaches zero, the character dies.&#x20;
* **Plasma:** This bar represents the character's ability to perform dodges. Each time a dodge is performed, the plasma bar decreases.

## Nightmare

The **nightmare** affects those players who spend a lot of time in the abyss. From 6 hours of continuous gameplay, a gradual decrease in the player's health begins, decreasing by a certain percentage with each additional hour of play. This effect persists until the player only has 20% health remaining. Typically, most players will not be affected.

It's possible to counteract the effects by staying disconnected from the game for the same amount of time accumulated from the nightmare. Or by acquiring a special potion that limits the negative impacts on the player's health, allowing them to prolong their gaming session.

### Objective

Other GameFi projects limit gaming sessions through an energy system. This system is inherited from poor monetization practices of mobile games. Its objective is to limit the number of tokens or NFTs a player can obtain to avoid disrupting the game's economy.

Instead of imposing restrictive time limits to monetize the game, we have developed a less intrusive energy system that allows players to have more control over their gaming time.

This approach prevents some players with more free time from unfairly benefiting over others with less availability while also mitigating long-term economic risks. Our goal is to promote a more equitable and sustainable gaming experience, where players enjoy greater freedom to play according to their preferences.

## Propiedades NFT

It's important to note that the containers do not possess NFT characteristics and therefore cannot be traded. The container is simply a virtual representation of the player in the Infernal Abyss, essential for their gaming experience but not designed to be exchanged or transferred between players.
