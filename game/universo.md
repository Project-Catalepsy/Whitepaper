# üåç Universe

In the dawn of time, in the primordial burst of the Big Bang, emerged a primordial entity, an amalgamation of chaos and order, embodying both light and darkness. This entity was God and Satan, two sides of the same coin, whose collaboration gave birth to the creation of the universe and Earth. However, when it came time to conceive an intelligent species, divergences arose between them. Their visions for humanity were opposing, triggering a fierce battle that culminated in separating their beings into individual entities.

After millennia of conflict, God finally managed to subdue Satan, banishing him to the dark abyss of the underworld. However, in his desperation, Satan did not lose hope of defeating his former companion. He subtly influenced the creation of humans, sending a serpent to tempt them and lead them into sin, casting them out of paradise and corrupting them on Earth, far from the divine rule.

As humans accumulate sins, they draw closer to Satan, who patiently awaits in the underworld, ready to receive the newcomers upon their deaths. However, many humans choose to live in penance, seeking redemption and distancing themselves from Satan's dominion. But something unsettling is happening in the underworld: the gates seem to be opening to welcome those who have not yet tasted death, while someone from the shadows conspires to bring non-mortal beings into their realm of darkness.

### Catalepsy

Upon your absorption, you arrive in an infinite white space‚Äîthe antechamber between heaven and abyss. Not knowing death, you wander suspended between heaven and the underworld, unsure if you are truly something or merely an empty vessel of what you once were. Before you, for better or worse, a giant gate emerges, revealing the sins you must atone for in the underworld. The doors open, and an unknown force absorbs you inside.

Upon reaching the underworld, you find yourself chained to the gate, with an insatiable thirst for blood-consuming you. You are neither alive nor dead, merely a hungry and desperate vessel. The gate demands blood as payment for your sins, and despair overwhelms you as you realize you cannot ignore its demand.

You must leap into the abyss, facing an uncertain and fearful fate to obtain the required blood. As you fall into the unknown, you wonder if you will survive this trial if you can redeem your sins, and if you will ever become human again. Doubts and fear overwhelm you, but only time and your determination will reveal your fate in this dark and murky journey into the unknown.
