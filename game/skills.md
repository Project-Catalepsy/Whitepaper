# ðŸ©¸ Skills

In the vast underworld, skills are the key to unlocking unique and powerful abilities that allow players to face the challenges encountered on their journey. The combination of these skills is based on the capabilities of the gate to which the container is linked.&#x20;

The choice and combination of skills not only reflect the player's playstyle but also determine the direction and power of their container in the underworld. With unique skills spanning a wide range of effects and capabilities, players can customize their containers to face the challenges they will encounter in their quest for redemption or power in the dark realm of the Seven Deadly Sins.
